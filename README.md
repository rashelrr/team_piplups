## About LionEats
Our service allows users to read and leave reviews for restaurants near campus
and around NYC.

## How to Run Service:
Service is hosted here: https://lioneats.herokuapp.com/

## How to Run Client:
Download the repo and enter into the terminal 'python3 client_app.py'.
Now enter "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" into the browser and navigate through the client!
- While testing, if you attempt to login and you run into a loop in which the client 
  keeps bringing you back and forth between the login and singup page, run this in
  the browser: https://lioneats.herokuapp.com/clear

## CI for Service: Travis CI
  - Click the green check mark at the top of the repo. Click 'Details' next to Travis
    CI. Click 'The build'. Travis CI will open in a new tab.
  - Under 'Job log' shows the CI report. Here you can see Travis runs our unit tests, 
    coverage tool, and style checker.

## Style Checker: Flake8
  - Report (bugs.txt) is in our repo 

## Coverage Tool: Coverage.py
  - Travis displays the coverage percentage for test_app.py and test_db.py under 'Job log'
  - The folder htmlcov/ in our repo also has test_app.py and test_db.py that you can open 
    on your computer to view the coverage percentages (download repo, run 'coverage html' 
    in terminal and then open up those files from htmlcov folder).

## Bug Finder: SonarCloud
  - Click the green check mark at the top of the repo. Click 'Details' next to SonarCloud
    and then 'View more details on SonarCloud.'

## System Tests for Service:
- Postman was used for testing GET and POST requests. 
  - See the Collections in Postman for our workspace.

---- @team: below needs to be updated for heroku----
Example assumption: All API entries assume the clientâ€™s user already has an account on Facebook and is currently logged into Facebook
Example expectation: The /do_something endpoint expects a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, a length of time in HH:MM 24-hour format, and an activity_name string of length minimum 8 characters and maximum 64 characters
Ideally, your documentation should also include a usage example for each API entry with both a request and possible responses (including error codes)
